Udacity self driving car nano degree project #6
## Reference: Udacity's path planning walkthrough session: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sI3VHFPP0w&feature=youtu.be
## This reference walked me through the following points:
- how to make the car goes straight
- how to make the car follow the path 
- how to reduce jerk at the cold start
- how to reduce the vehicle speed when facing the front car to avoid collision.
